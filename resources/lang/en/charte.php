   'content' => '"We do not have a second chance to make the first good impression"<br/><br/>

				At Extras Me, we hope to have motivated students so they can proudly represent the values of their respective hotel school.<br/><br/>

				Indeed, it is essential to have some information transparency in order to develop your student profile based solely on your own past personal experiences.<br/><br/>

				When you apply for an extra, it is essential to visit the company\'s profile to find out about your employer.<br/><br/>

				You can not present yourself to your extra under the influence of alcohol or drugs and you must respect the rules drawn up by the company you work for.<br/><br/>

				The company where you will be working is counting on you! Therefore, it is not allowed for you to be late, you are even advised to be on site 15 minutes in advance in order to be as professional as possible.<br/><br/>

				During your extra, you must follow the instructions of your employer. We advise you to be persistent, friendly and respectful to your employer, but also to the customers of your employer. This will play in your favour for future extra applications.<br/><br/>

				All discrimination against your colleagues, your employer or your employer\'s customers will be punished.<br/><br/>

				Once the extra is over, it is essential to thank your employer for giving you the opportunity to work for him. Your employer will then see the warm person you are, who in the future will again delight its customers.<br/><br/>

				It is strictly forbidden to accept the offer of a professional who would circumvent Extras Me services under penalty of law.<br/><br/>

				Finally, do not forget that your employer knows your school and that you represent it proudly!<br/><br/>

				Good Extra!<br/><br/>
